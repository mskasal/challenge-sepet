```

### Notes about challenge

#### What did I do?
I created a search page for an restaurant.
A customer can search and find any product and category.
They can add items to basket or delete them or change count of them.

- I used Webpack for developer server and bundler.
- I used Babel for transpiler
- Project developed with mostly ES6 and awesome features of it.
- I experimented Web Components for a small/mid project and loved it.

#### What did I do not?
- I did not think about browser compatibility. I used Chrome for development and debugging.
Custom components could not work as expected on other browsers
- I did not write any test. (maybe later, I need a good way to test custom components).

#### What did I assume?

- I assumed any restaurant menu can not be so big for listing(+200 ;)).

#### Why Web Components?

- Just for experiment and fun.

=> Additional notes

I left some codes behind which I can refactor easily on purpose.
So, I can play/think a bit about app structure.

I really liked everything about Web Components, High-level views, Shadow roots(I did not use it here).

PS. Please open this app on Chrome Browser.

Thanks.
